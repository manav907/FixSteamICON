The repo exists to allow fixing steam (web) shortcuts having blank icons due to a specific issue.

this issue cannot be fixed by simply rebuilding icon cache and or selecting "internet browerser" as defult for .url extensions\
this issue can be reproduced by having an external drive/folder for steam apps and uninstalling and reinstalling steam and reusing already installed contents of said external drive so as to avoid reinstalling steamapps.

the primary cause for this issue is that when you avoid redownloading steamapps and instead use and external steam liberary folder after reinstalling steam the /steam/games folder inside the primary steam directory does not get repopulated with .ico files of steamapps that you did not redownload
